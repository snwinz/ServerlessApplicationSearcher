# ServerlessApplicationSearcher

The program requires a github token connected with a github account. The token is saved as a system variable 'GITHUB_API_TOKEN'.

The result of the search is saved in a file which contains the applications identified with relevant information. The file is evaluated by the tool afterwards.
